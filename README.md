# Merch Landing App
A simple landing page for the sale of merchandise 
(in the example used T-shirts). 
**All HTML and 60% CSS code was generated using 
poe.com neural network.** 
I just wrote a framework for it on the 
Flask framework language Python, slightly 
corrected the CSS and adapted it to any device. 

#### **YES!** The site is fully adaptive ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥‚

This project can be used as an example and basis for larger projects and sites.

## Ideas and possible future updates
1. Connect the database. Get reviews, products and text from tables.
2. Add an admin panel to adjust text, colors, fonts, and add products themselves.
3. Add nice smooth animations of page loading and generally work on icons and details. The site is empty, so the neural network decided.
4. Send my portfolio as a frontend to an IT company (I'm zero-skilled in JS).
